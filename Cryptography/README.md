# About this Folder — Cryptography

There’s never really an end to any topic — the deeper you dive, the more treasures you discover.  
This folder contains everything I’m learning about **Cryptography**.

- [Crypto Notes](https://github.com/Drashti-007/C-System/blob/main/Cryptography/crypto_notes.md) — Contains everything I’ve learned (and am still learning). Concepts are briefly explained here, with detailed breakdowns linked to supporting files for deeper understanding. 

Lastly, I’ll keep adding more notes, files, and codes as my understanding of this topic evolves.
