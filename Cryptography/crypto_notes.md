# Cryptography

It's a technique of securing information and communication using code to ensure *confidentiality*, *integrity*, and *authentication*. 
Cryptography prevents unauthorized access to information.

These algorithm are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signature/signing, and verification to protect data privacy, web browsiong
on the internet and to protect confidential transactions such as credict card and debit card transactions.

## Types of Cryptography
- Symmetric Key Cryptography
   - Same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
   - Example: Caesar Cipher, DES, AES.
   - Faster but less secure if key is leaked.

- Asymmetric Key Cryptography
   - Two keys: Public (shared) and Private (kept secret)
   - Sender encrypts using public key, receiver decrypt using private key.
   - Example: RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
   - More secure, but slower than symmetric.
