# C Systems

This repository contains core C-language implementations exploring **Cryptography**, **Blockchain**, and **Networking** concepts.  
Each folder represents one major area of system-level understanding.

## Structure
- **cryptography/** → Basic encryption & hashing algorithms (Caesar, XOR, SHA-256 logic)
- **blockchain/** → Block creation, linking, and simple chain simulation
- **networking/** → Client-server communication using socket programming

## Goals
- Understand and manually read/analyze C code.
- Implement, compile, and push working code.
